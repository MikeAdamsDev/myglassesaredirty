<h2 id="about-the-author">About the author</h2>
<p><img src="profilepic-200px.jpg" alt="profile pic of the author"></p>
<p>With more than 25 years in software engineering, technical documentation and product development, I specialise in designing and delivering high-quality, developer-friendly documentation and API solutions that make products more usable and successful.</p>
<p>I thrive at the intersection of technology, design, and communication â€” whether managing teams, improving developer onboarding, or building scalable content systems using Docs-as-Code principles. My approach combines attention to detail with creative, systems-level thinking to solve problems at their root.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m currently exploring the future of developer experience: from AI-native product design to the next generation of semantic, self-describing APIs.</p>
<p>Always curious, always improving, always with a slightly offbeat sense of humour :-)</p>
