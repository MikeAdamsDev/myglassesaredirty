<p>So, the journey begins&hellip;</p>
<p>In a world dominated by short-attention-span video reels, I still believe there’s a place for thoughtful, well-crafted writing on professional topics — as long as it stays short and relevant. I’m always generating ideas, making discoveries, and reflecting on my work, and it makes sense to share those learnings with the community. It’s also a valuable discipline to shape those thoughts into a coherent blog post.</p>
<p><strong>API documentation</strong> in particular is something I feel is under-discussed; I’m often disappointed when I look for examples of how others have solved the challenges I face day to day.</p>
<p>As a technical documentation specialist, all of this is my bread and butter!</p>
<p>So, in 2025 I’m launching this website to share what I learn, what I’m building, and what I’m questioning — and maybe spark some useful conversations along the way.</p>
<p><em>I hope you’ll join me on the journey.</em></p>
